# Martian Robots

## Assumptions:
I assume the instructions means lines from the input and the coordinates x and y. I throw an exception when these are reached

## Scalability:
I left the 2 classes uncoupled for scalablility reasons. Example: adding another command for move backwards by adding only to the Robot class
